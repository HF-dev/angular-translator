Here is Angular Translator, the ultimate tool to translate your Angular applications.

You first have to create a new project with the New Project button.

There is some predefined information that you can use if you want to test the translation of this particular application.

The application needs to know the github repository where your app sources can be found, 
the directory in which are placed the i18n files,
and the names of the source and translation files.

The source file contains the original terms written by the developers and the contexts for these terms (files, lines, meaning, description).

The translation files will contain the translations written with this app. At this time, they are empty or even non-existant.

Let's create our first project with these default information.

The application has loaded the source file. It has detected its format (xmb) and has found 32 messages in it.

We can now select a translation file to begin the translation for a specific language, for example french.

====

At this point, we are ready to begin the translation.

Before, we can hide this information message, we can display the details of the locations where are found each terms
and we can display the list of untranslated terms only.

Let's start the translation.

You can see in the left the term extracted from the source file.

We can write our translation in the right textarea and press ctrl-enter to save and go to the next term to translate.

====

Angular uses some particular format to handle plurals and selects. We have here an example of a plural translation. 

The formatted language is not easy to read. 

We will be able to use the ICU builder to build this message with a friendly interface.

At this point, we can at least understand the format of the message.
